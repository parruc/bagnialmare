"<p>Once upon a time there were four friends from Forl√¨ that at the first "
"sign of summer used to escape from the heat and the boredom of the city to "
"the beaches on the Adriatic coast. The same beaches where only a \"few\" "
"years earlier we used to play with buckets and spades.</p>\n"
"<p>Summers of foosball, beach volley, table tennis, swimming, books, nights "
"out and... we are still here! With the aim of supporting the tradition and "
"the passion that make the beaches of our coast unique and overall.. a place "
"that fits everyone's taste.</p>\n"
